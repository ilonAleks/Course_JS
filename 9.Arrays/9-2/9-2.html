	<h3>Task 9-2</h3>
	<p>
		Imagine that we are developing a queue system for any institution. For example, for mail. For this we are
		created an array peopleWaiting, which displays the current status of the queue.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>peopleWaiting = ['Christina ',' Oleg ',' Cyril ',' Maria ',' Svetlana ',' Artem ',' Gleb'];</strong><br>
		<br>
		Logically, Christina will receive the next parcel by mail, after it the 1st in line will be Oleg. <br>
		Now you need to realize the following logic in the code step by step:

		Christina and Oleg received parcels and left the queue. You need to remove them from the array.
		Now the turn came to Cyril. And unexpectedly, an employee of the post office says that they soon have a lunch break
		and she
		only Cyril will have time to serve. Therefore, all other people standing behind Cyril decided not to wait until it
		ends
		lunch, and just left the post office. You first need to remove Cyril from an array peopleWaiting, and then
		delete people who did not have time to get parcels.
		When a person receives a parcel, it is necessary to display a message in the modal window “name received the
		package. The queue remains length people.” (Replace name in the name of the person who received the parcel, and
		length - with the number
		the person who remained in line). <br>
		<br>
		If a person did not receive a parcel and left the line, then bring in the modal window through the Alert the message
		“NAME not
		received a parcel and left from the line. ”<br>
		<br>
		It is recommended to create 2 functions: giveParcel - to issue a parcel and deleting a client from the start of an
		array,
		leaveQueueWithoutParcel - to delete a client who did not receive a parcel from the end of the list.
