	<h3>Task 9-5</h3>
	<p>
		You have developed the main functionality that Alexey wanted to see on his website. He tells you great
		thank you because thanks to the site in the coffee shop, the number of sales has increased. Now Alexey wanted to
		raise the price for
		coffee, so that there are even more profit.<br>
		<br>
		You initially have 2 arrays: coffees (keeps the names of coffee) and prices (keeps coffee prices). Indices for names
		coffee and prices are interconnected. Those, “Latte” costs 1.5 euros, “Cappuccino” - 1 euro, etc.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>coffees = ['Latte', 'Cappuccino', 'Americano'];<br>
			const prices = [1.5, 1, 2];</strong><br>
		<br>
		You need to create a new array updatedPrices, which will contain the same numbers from the array prices, but only
		increased by 0.5.<br>
		<br>
		After raising prices, you need to notify the coffee houses about this, so bring for each type of coffee
		message through Alert “Coffee Name now stands Price Euro”, where NAME is the name of coffee, and Price is an updated
		price for
		Coffee. <BR>
