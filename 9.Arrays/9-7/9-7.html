	<h3>Task 9-7</h3>
	<p>
		Imagine that your friend is the owner of an amateur football club. Team players score many goals and
		employees of the club were tired of counting all the statistics every time after the match. Therefore, they decided
		to ask you as
		web developer help solve this problem. You need to optimize the task of counting statistics using a language
		programming JavaScript.<br>
		<br>
		You have a Goals array in which each index means the played match, and the number under the index is the number of
		goals
		scored in a specific match.<br>
		<br>
		<b>const goals = [8, 1, 1, 3, 2, -1, 5];</b><br>
		<br>
		That is, in the 1st match, the team scored 8 goals, in the 2nd-one, etc. If there is a negative number in the array,
		then it means
		that the team counted automatic defeat.<br>
		<br>
		Using this GOALS array, you need to derive the following statistics for the entire season.
	<ol>
		<li>The most productive match is the number of heads. Bring in the modal window through the Alert message “The most
			productive match was Number number. It was clogged numberOfGoals goals.” (replace number on the
			serial number of the match, andnumberOfGoals - for the number of goals in the most effective match).</li>
		<li>The most ineffective games. There are several of them in the array, so you need to withdraw through alert
			message “The most
			Non-effective matches were under numbers numbers. In each of them it was clogged numberOfGoals goals.”
			(replace Numbers with ordinal numbers of matches and display them through a comma, and numberOfGoals - by the
			number of goals
			in the most non-important match). Do not take into account the game with automatic defeat.</li>
		<li>The total number of goals per season. Do not take into account the game with automatic defeat. Bring the message
			through
			alert “The total number of goals per season is numberOfGoals” (replace numberOfGoals for the number of total
			quantities
			heads for the season).</li>
		<li>Were there automatic defeats. If it's were, then bring the message through alert “There were automatic defeats:
			Yes”, otherwise “There were automatic defeats: No ”.</li>
		<li>The average number of goals per match. Bring the message through alert “The average number of goals per match is
			numberOfGoals” (replace numberOfGoals for the average number of goals per match).</li>
		<li>Sort goals in an increase in order and bring all the results through a comma in a modal window alert. Array
			goals should not be changed.</li>
	</ol>
