	<h3>Task 9-Additional-2</h3>
	<p>
		With the help of For cycles, you need to create a 3x5 matrix. In the end, it should look as follows:<br>
		<br>
		0: (5) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
		1: (5) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
		2: (5) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
		<br>
		Hint: as you can see, in the end it turned out to be an array of 3 elements, inside of which arrays are stored, each
		of
		which has 5 elements. This can be implemented using 2 Forb cycles. Inside one cycle for
		place another cycle.
