	<h3>Task 9-6</h3>

		coffee shops. Also create a function askClientToGiveEstimation, which should display the message “How do you
		evaluate our
		Coffee shop from 1 to 10? " through prompt. The final result that the user will introduce should be a type
		number data.
		If the number from 1 to 10 was introduced, then add this assessment to the array clientsEstimations, otherwise no
		action
		perform.<br>
		<br>

		for.<br>
		<br>
		After the estimates are added, you need to calculate positive and negative assessments. Positive
		assessment is the number more than 5, negative - the number less in 5 or equal to 5. Derived through alert message
		“All positive assessments: goodEstimations; All negative assessments: notGoodEstimations”, where goodEstimations -
		the number of positive assessments, and notGoodEstimations - the number of negative assessments.<br>
