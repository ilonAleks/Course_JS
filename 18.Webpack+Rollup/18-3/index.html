	<h3>Task 18-3</h3>
	<p>
		You have successfully initialized the project on <b>rollup.js</b>. The whole development team is happy with you,
		because everyone can now start implementing the functionality.<br>
		<br>
		Your boss has figured out that you're a pretty good developer and is asking you to help start another project. The
		only thing is that the requirement from the customer is the following: you must use only <b>webpack.js</b>.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Your job now</b> is to start from an empty folder and initialize the project with <b>webpack.js</b>.<br>
		<br>
		In the project folder, create 3 files: index.html, index.css and index.js. <b>Add</b> some basic html markup to
		<b>index.html</b>. Next, create a package.json file with the npm init -y command. Also in <b>index.js</b> add a line
		of code <b>console.log('Hello World!');</b><br>
		<br>
		<b>Now, following the webpack.js documentation</b> <a
			href="https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/">(https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/)</a>, video
		tutorial, install webpack as a package and create the <b>webpack.config.js</b> config file.<br>
		<br>
		In <b>webpack.config.js</b> , add the basic configuration to start the project. Entry, output and mode properties
		will suffice for this. Don't add any plugins yet.<br>
		<br>
		Then add the <b>“start”</b> command to the package.json file.<br>
		"start": "webpack --config webpack.config.js"<br>
		<b>Then</b> run the <b>"start"</b> command. You should generate a JS file, the name of which you specified in the
		<b>“output”</b> property in the <b>webpack.config.js</b> file. If the file is not generated, then you may have done
		something wrong and you have an error. In this case, you need to find it and fix it.
