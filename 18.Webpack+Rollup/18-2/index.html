	<h3>Task 18-2</h3>
	<p>
		<b>You are well done!</b> You have initialized the project. But that's not all, as you also need to take into
		account the following things:
	<ol>
		<li>Connecting styles;</li>
		<li>Working with pictures;</li>
		<li>Code support by other browsers;</li>
		<li>Run the project on the local server (localhost).</li>
	</ol>
	So that's what you're going to do now. Several plugins <b>need to be installed</b> as <b>devDependencies</b>.
	<ol>
		<li>Use “rollup-plugin-styles” to include styles: <a
				href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-styles">https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-styles</a>
		</li>
		<li>To work with "rollup-plugin-img" images: <a
				href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-img">https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-img</a></li>
		<li>To translate JavaScript into code that even older browsers support, use “@rollup/plugin-babel”: <a
				href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-babel">https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-babel</a>
		</li>
		<li>To run the project on a local server, you need the “rollup-plugin-serve” (<a
				href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-serve">https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-serve</a>)
			and “rollup-plugin-livereload” (https://www. npmjs.com/package/rollup-plugin-livereload).</li>
	</ol>
	<b>Then</b> create an <b>assets</b> folder and add any picture with the image of the JavaScript programming language
	to it. Now in the <b>index.js</b> file, you need to add two elements to the DOM:
	<ol>
		<li>h1. This element should contain the inscription “I love JavaScript”;</li>
		<li>img. This element should display an image from the assets folder.</li>
	</ol>
	<b>In addition</b>, in <b>index.css</b>, add any styles to your taste. The main thing is that this file is not
	empty.<br>
	<br>
	Then run the <b>“start”</b> command and use the script tag to include the js file generated by the <b>rollup.js</b>
	package into <b>index.html</b>.<br>
	<br>
	As a result, you should have a picture displayed, all styles applied, and a local server should open. If something
	went wrong, then you may have an error. In this case, you need to find it and fix it.
