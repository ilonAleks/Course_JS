	<h3>Task 18-4</h3>
	<p>
		<b>You are well done!</b> Even webpack.js is up to you! Now you need to deal with the same points that were when
		using
		rollup.js:<br>
	<ol>
		<li>Connecting styles;</li>
		<li>Working with pictures;</li>
		<li>Code support by other browsers;</li>
		<li>Run the project on the local server (localhost).</li>
	</ol>
	<b>You need</b> to install some plugins as <b>devDependencies</b> and add some code to the config file.<br>
	<ol>
		<li>Use “css-loader” <a
				href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-loader">(https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-loader)</a> and
			“style-loader”
			<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/style-loader">(https://www.npmjs.com/package/style-loader)</a> to include
			styles.
		</li>
		<li>To work with images, add this code to <b>webpack.config.js</b><br>
			<xmp>
				module: {
				rules: [
				{
				test: /\.(?:ico|gif|png|jpg|jpeg)$/i,
				type: 'asset/resource',
				},
				{
				test: /\.(woff(2)?|eot|ttf|otf|svg|)$/,
				type: 'asset/inline',
				},
				],
				},
			</xmp>
		</li>
		<li>To translate JavaScript into code that even older browsers support, use the <b>"babel-loader"</b>
			<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader">(https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader)</a>.
		</li>
		<li>To run the project on a local server, you will need the <b>“webpack-dev-server”</b> plugin
			<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server">(https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server)</a>.
			To configure it, add this code to
			webpack.config.js:
			<xmp>
				devServer: {
				open: true
				compression: true
				port: 4000
				},</xmp>
		</li>
	</ol>
	<b>Also</b>, in order for webpack to process HTML and automatically include JavaScript in it, you need to install the
	<b>html-webpack-plugin</b> <a
		href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin">(https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin)</a>.
	Add this code to
	webpack.config.js to
	configure this package:
	<xmp>
		plugins: [
		new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
		template: 'index.html'
		}),
		]</xmp>
	<b>Then</b> add the code that you wrote when using <b>rollup.js</b> to the <b>index.js</b> file. Also don't forget to
	add the image to
	<b>assets</b> and copy the <b>index.css</b> file with styles.<br>
	<br>
	<b>In addition</b>, replace the commands in <b>package.json</b> with the following:<br>
	"start": "webpack serve",<br>
	"prod": "webpack"<br>
	<b>Then</b> run the <b>"start"</b> command. If you did everything correctly and followed the instructions in the
	plugin installation
	links, then you should have a local server open. You should also have an image from <b>assets</b> displayed and all
	styles
	applied. If something went wrong, then you may have an error. In this case, you need to find it and fix it.
