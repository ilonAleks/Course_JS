	<h3>Task 18-1</h3>
	<p>
		You have been assigned to a project where you are the main developer. No one has written the code yet, and therefore
		your task is to make the basic configuration of the project from an empty folder.<br>
		<br>
		To do this, use <b>rollup.js</b>. Now in the project folder create 3 files: index.html, index.css and index.js. Add
		some basic html markup to <b>index.html</b>. Next, create a <b>package.json</b> file with the <b>npm init -y</b>
		command. Also in index.js add a line of code <b>console.log('Hello World!');</b><br>
		<br>
		<b>Now, following the rollup.js documentation</b> (<a
			href="https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/">https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/</a>) tutorial video, install <b>rollup</b> as
		a package and create the <b>rollup.config.js</b> config file. In <b>rollup.config.js</b> , add the basic
		configuration to run the project. Entry, output and watch properties will suffice for this. Don't add any plugins
		yet.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Then</b> in the package.json file create 2 commands <b>"build"</b> and <b>"start"</b>.<br>
		"build": "rollup -c",<br>
		"start": "rollup -c -w"<br>
		<b>Then</b> run the <b>"start"</b> command. You should generate a JS file, the name of which you specified in the
		<b>“output”</b> property in the <b>rollup.config.js</b> file. If the file is not generated, then you may have done
		something wrong and you have an error. In this case, you need to find it and fix it.
