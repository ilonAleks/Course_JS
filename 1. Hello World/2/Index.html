		Task 2
	</h3>

	<p>
		In the previous task, you have already created 2 files and connected Index.js to index.html. It's time to work with
		JavaScript.
		<BR>
		To get started, open the index.html file in the browser. It is recommended to use Google Chrome.
		<BR>
		Now, using JavaScript, you need to create a simple timer that will show the return countdown. For
		This will take this into the console the line “start the timer” using the CONSOLE.LOG function. Then add 6 Alert
		functions,
		Each of which will withdraw the number from 5 and ending with zero. After the output of zero, write the line of
		code,
