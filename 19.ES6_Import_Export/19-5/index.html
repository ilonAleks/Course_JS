    <h3>Task 19-5</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Congratulations!</b> You have almost completely implemented the donation application. You now have the logic
        of creating donations and rendering all the necessary HTML elements.<br>
        <br>
        Now it remains to work a little with the quality of the written code.<br>
        <br>
        To begin with, let's note that we have all the amounts written in dollars "$". And imagine that a customer comes
        and says: "Let's all the amounts be in euros." With the current implementation, you will have to fix the dollar
        sign to the euro in all possible files, which is of course inconvenient. There is a solution for this. Create a
        global value and use it throughout the project.<br>
        <br>
        Therefore, in the <b>core folder</b>, create a <b>constants folder</b>. In the <b>constants folder</b>, create a
        <b>settings.js</b> file that will store the <b>Settings</b> object. In this object, create a currency key, which
        will have the value <b>“$”</b>. Export Settings and then use import to replace all "$" signs in the files with
        Settings.currency.<br>
        <br>
        <b>After the work done</b>, you can safely change the value of the currency property in the <b>Settings</b>
        object, and the currency will change throughout the project.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Condition:</b> when importing, you must use the <b>as</b> keyword at least once. For example, import { Object
        as Obj }.
