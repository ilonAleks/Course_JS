    <h3>Task 19-6</h3>
    <p>
        The project is almost ready and it remains to do only a few important things.
        Now you will need to create auxiliary functions that will be used globally according to the project.<br>

        <b>To get started </b> create a folder <b>utils в core</b>. In <b>utils</b> create a file index.js.
        This file will be stored all auxiliary functions that relate to the project.<br>

        The first auxiliary function should be called <b>calculateSumOfNumbers</b>.
        It is accepted as an array parameter <b>numbers</b>, which consists exclusively of numbers.
        Function <b>calculateSumOfNumbers</b> considers the sum of all elements of the array and returns its final
        value.<br>

        The second function will be responsible for the conversion of the date.
        What is the function <b>getFormattedTime</b>.
        She takes one parameter <b>date</b>, which is an object <b>Date</b>.
        Initially <b>new Date()</b> when converting to a line, approximately such a value returns <b>“Tue Jul 06 2021
            14:00:05 GMT+0300 (Moscow
            Standard Time)”</b>.
        Function <b>getFormattedTime</b> should transform it to this value <b>“July
            6th 2021, 2:00:05 pm”</b>.
        This can be done using the library <b>momentjs</b>.<br>
        moment(date).format('MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a')<br>
        Install <b>momentjs <a href='https://momentjs.com/'>(https://momentjs.com/)</a> and implement the function
            <b>getFormattedTime</b>.<br>

            After you need to export these functions and use in the code.<br>

            Let's start with <b>calculateSumOfNumbers</b>.
            Create in the file <b>app.js</b> array <b>mockDonates</b> and pass it as a value in <b>donates</b> at the
            object <b>state</b>.<br>
            const mockDonates = [<br>
            { amount: 4, date: new Date() },<br>
            { amount: 20, date: new Date() },<br>
            { amount: 3, date: new Date() },<br>
            { amount: 1, date: new Date() },<br>
            ];<br>

            Since we have initial values <b>donates</b> but <b>totalAmount</b> by default it costs like 0,
            then it is necessary to calculate the initial amount of all donates and rewrite the value
            <b>totalAmount</b>.
            The already created will help you with this function <b>calculateSumOfNumbers</b>.<br>

            Second auxiliary function <b>getFormattedTime</b> нou need to use for elements with classes
            <b>“donate-item”</b>.
            Before that, the text in these elements looked as follows “Tue Jul 06 2021 14:00:05
            GMT+0300 (Moscow Standard Time) - 4$”.
            Using <b>getFormattedTime</b> The text should become so “July 6th 2021, 2:00:05 pm - 4$”.

            <b>Condition:</b> цhen importing you need to use the design <b>“import * as”</b>.
