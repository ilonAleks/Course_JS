    <h3>Task 19-3</h3>
    <p>
        <b>You are well done!</b> You are creating a cool donation service step by step and you are doing well.<br>
        <b>Now you will need</b> to draw a list of all donations that users of the service will make.<br>

        In the <b>modules</b> folder, create a <b>donate-list.js</b> file and implement the <b>DonateList</b> class in
        it. The constructor of this class must accept an array of <b>donates</b>. This array consists of objects that
        have the keys <b>date</b> (the date the donation was created) and amount (the amount of the donation). Also in
        the <b>DonateList</b> class, implement the <b>render</b> method, which will render the HTML template below.
        <xmp>
            <div class="donates-container">
                <h2 class="donates-container__title">List of donations</h2>
                <div class="donates-container__donates">
                    <div class="donate-item">July 6th 2021, 10:28:49 am - <b>$4</b></div>
                    <div class="donate-item">July 6th 2021, 10:28:49 am - <b>$20</b></div>
                    <div class="donate-item">July 6th 2021, 10:28:49 am - <b>$3</b></div>
                    <div class="donate-item">July 6th 2021, 10:28:49 am - <b>$1</b></div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </xmp>
        This HTML element is responsible for the donate element:
        <xmp>
            <div class="donate-item">July 6th 2021, 10:28:49 am - <b>$4</b></div>
        </xmp>

        <br><br><br>
        Here “July 6th 2021, 10:28:49 am” is the value of the <b>date</b> property from the <b>donates</b> array object,
        and “4$” is the value of the <b>amount</b> property from the <b>donates</b> array object.<br>

        Export the <b>DonateList</b> (export) class. Then import it into the <b>app.js</b> file.<br>
        Through the <b>run</b> method of the <b>App</b> class and with the help of <b>DonateList</b>, you need to place
        the entire layout of the donations list inside the element with the <b>body</b> tag.<br>

        To test the rendering of the list of donations, use this <b>donates</b> array.<br>
        const mockDonates = [<br>
        { amount: 4, date: new Date() },<br>
        { amount: 20, date: new Date() },<br>
        { amount: 3, date: new Date() },<br>
        { amount: 1, date: new Date() },<br>
        ];<br>
        <b>Note 1:</b> to separate the logic, it is allowed to create your own fields and methods in the
        <b>DonateList</b> class. Make them private whenever possible so that you can write pure OOP code and apply the
        principle of encapsulation.<br>

        <b>Note 2:</b> now you have the date text in the donation HTML element will not be displayed as in the HTML
        template. Don't worry, it's normal. You will develop this logic later.
