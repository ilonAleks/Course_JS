    <h3>Task 19-3</h3>
    <p>
        In the tasks of this lesson, you will create from scratch a service for donating money for charitable
        purposes.<br>
        <br>
        You initially have an initialized empty project. <b>You need</b> to download it and open it in a code
        editor.<br>
        <a href='https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aQzVQ_5bkm71IKgTi6CAZTXMLJvVJbgi?usp=sharing'>Link to
            download</a><br>
        <br>
        <b>Install</b> all packages with the "npm i" command and then run the project itself with "npm start".<br>
        <br>
        One of the important parts of a project before starting development is the folder structure. In the root of the
        project, create the <b>src</b> folder, and in it 2 more - <b>core</b> and <b>modules</b>. The <b>core</b> folder
        will be needed for the global parts of the project, and <b>modules</b>, for the main blocks of the project (for
        example, a list of donations, a form for sending donations, etc.).<br>
        <br>
        In the <b>modules</b> folder, create an app.js file and in this file you need to implement the <b>App</b> class.
        This class should have a <b>run</b> method that puts the text <b>"Hello World"</b> inside the <b>body</b>
        tag.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Import the default</b> (export default) <b>App</b> class in the <b>index.js</b> file, instantiate the
        <b>App</b> class, and call the <b>run</b> method.
