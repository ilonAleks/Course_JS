	<h3>Task 11-1</h3>
	<p>
		Often we write down dates in the following format “day.month.year”. Now you need to create a function
		<b>getDateFormat</b>,
		which will take 2 parameters:
	<ol>
		<li>date. The object of the date that needs to be transferred to this text format “day.month.year”.</li>
		<li>separator. The division of the day, month and year. By default, it should be equal to the point ".". If in
			quality
			the separator will be transmitted to the dash “-”, then the format should already be like that “day-month-year”.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<b>Also </b>, note that the number of the month in JavaScript is considered from 0 to 11. In addition, if a day or a
	month is returned
	a definite number, then you need to add 0 to it. That is, the result should not be so “5.5.2001”, but
	"05.05.2001".
