	<h3>Task 11-Additional</h3>
	<p>
		Your customer is a visa center. They have a customer database, but there is no script that would automate the
		process
		Visa issuing. Therefore, the visa center asked you to help you as a web developer to take this task for
		yourself.<br>
		<br>
		<b>You need to </b> create a function <b>allowVisa</b>, which accepts an array of customers of the visa center.
		<b> Each client </b> -
		this is an object with parameters<b>firstName</b> (client's name), <b>lastName</b> (client's lastname),
		<b>criminalRecord</b>
		(type of data boolean,
		is there a criminal record), <b>passportExpiration</b> (type of data string, date of expiration of the
		passport).<br>
		<br>
		Function <b>allowVisa</b> must return the filtered array <b> people </b> so that it satisfies the next
		conditions:
	<ol>
		<li>The current date should be less than the property passportExpiration.</li>
		<li>The client should not have a criminal record, the value of the property criminalRecord should be equal false.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<b>For the test of the function </b>, use this code:<br>
	<br>
	const peopleWithVisa = [<br>
	&nbsp {<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp firstName: 'Stasia',<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp lastName: 'Ward',<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp criminalRecord: true,<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp passportExpiration: '19.06.2024',<br>
	&nbsp },<br>
	&nbsp {<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp firstName: 'Elliot',<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp lastName: 'Baker',<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp criminalRecord: false,<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp passportExpiration: '04.06.2023',<br>
	&nbsp },<br>
	&nbsp {<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp firstName: 'Leighann',<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp lastName: 'Scott',<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp criminalRecord: true,<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp passportExpiration: '31.07.2023',<br>
	&nbsp },<br>
	&nbsp {<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp firstName: 'Nick',<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp lastName: 'Pop',<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp criminalRecord: false,<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp passportExpiration: '31.12.2022',<br>
	&nbsp },<br>
	];<br>
	<br>
	const result = allowVisa(peopleWithVisa);<br>
	console.log('result', result);<br>
