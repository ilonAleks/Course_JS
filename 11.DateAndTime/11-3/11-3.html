	<h3>Task 11-3</h3>
	<p>
		In JavaScript, the date of the date can accept TimeStamp, i.e. the number of milliseconds from January 1, 1970
		00:00:00
		by UTC. According to this amount of milliseconds, an object of date is generated.<br>
		<br>
		Thanks to this, to add a certain number of milliseconds, you can use the following entry: <b>new
			Date(Date.now() + 5000)</b>, where 5000 - this is milliseconds. As a result, we will receive a date, which is 5000
		milliseconds
		more
		current.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Using this knowledge, you need to </b> create the addDays function that accepts 2 parameters:
	<ol>
		<li>date. Date object.</li>
		<li>days. The number of days, the type of data is Number, by silence this parameter should be equal to one.</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<b>You need </b> to the parameter <b>date</b> add a certain number of days that is transmitted to the parameter
	<b>days</b>. Function
	<b>addDays</b> must return the updated date.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Hint: </b> do not forget that <b>timestamp</b>, which is transmitted to Date should be measured in milliseconds.
