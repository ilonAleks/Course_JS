	<h3>Task 6-5</h3>
	<p>
		Imagine that we are developing a site for a restaurant in which the discount program operates. The restaurant
		calculates
		the amount of payment for each client encourages the most frequent visitors.<br>
		<br>
		At the moment, the restaurant has a client named Igor, who for all the time spent 110$ in this institution.
		Save this data in variables <b>clientName</b> and <b>clientSpentForAllTime</b>.<br>
		<br>
		<b>The discount program works as follows:</b>
	<ol>
		<li>If the client spent from 100$ to 300$, then a 10%discount; </li>
		<li> If the client spent from 300$ to 500$, then the discount is 20%; </li>
		<li> If the client spent from 500$, then the discount is 30%.</li>
	</ol>
	A client named Igor decided to visit a restaurant again. As we see, he is supposed to be a 10% discount, since he
	spent 110$. Now Igor is purchased at 25$ and he needs to provide a discount. Save value
	25 in the variable clientSpentToday.<br>
	<br>
	<b>First, implement the logic of discounts. </b> Use if else and logical operators.The final
	discount
	save in a variable discount. Bring in a modal window through alert text “You are given a discount in
	discount%!” (discount replace the percentage of discounts).<br>
	<br>
	<b>After that, it is necessary </b> to set a client named Igor for payment (given the discount). To begin with, update
	variable <b>clientSpentForAllTime</b>. Then bring in a modal window through alert message “Thank you, clientName! You
	will
	pay clientSpentToday$. For all the time in our restaurant you spent clientSpentForAllTime$.” (replace clientName,
	clientSpentToday and clientSpentForAllTime to the corresponding values of the variables)
