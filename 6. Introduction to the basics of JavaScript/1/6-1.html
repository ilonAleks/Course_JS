	<h3>Task 1</h3>
	<p>
		The form of authorization and registration is a very popular and integral part of many websites. Now you will
		develop
		it on JavaScript.
		<br>
		<br>
		Imagine that on our website there is a user who has a login is “The_Best_user”, and the password is “12345678”.
		Save these values in variables and name them existedUserLogin and existedUserPassword, respectively.<br>
		<br>
		<b>You need </b> using the prompt function to display 2 modal windows per screen. The 1st will be with the
		inscription "Enter Login ”, 2nd - "Enter password". Save the values introduced by the user into the variable
		userLogin and userPassword. Also note that in the final data of the user there should not be extra spaces at the
		beginning and at
		the end of the line. Use the trim method, to remove extra gaps.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>If the user entered the login and password coincides </b> with existing data in existedUserLogin and
		existededUserPassword, then bring in the modal window using Alert the message “Welcome, userlogin!”
		(Replace userlogin with user login).Otherwise, display the message “Login and (or) password is entered
		incorrectly!”.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Note: </b> Never in the development of web applications do not use the incomparable comparison “==”. It is
		initiator a large number of bugs, as it transforms types.Use an exceptionally strict comparison
		"===". It does not convert types and reduces the chance of errors.
		In subsequent tasks, also use a strict comparison “===”.
