	<h3>Task 2</h3>
	<p>
		This code requests the names of new students 3 times and, if the student’s name was introduced, he is welcomed
		message “Welcome, newStudent!” (newStudent - student's name).
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>You need to </b> rewrite this cycle for the cycle with while and do while, so that the logic of code execution
		and
		result remained unchanged.
		<br>
