	<h3>Task 6-6</h3>
	<p>
		Congratulations! You have developed the logic of discounts to the restaurant customers. You optimized the big task,
		because earlier discounts were considered manually.<br>
		<br>
		You have already worked with predetermined data <b>clientName</b>, <b>clientSpentToday</b> and
		<b>clientSpentForAllTime</b>. But there are many customers at restaurant
		and everyone buys dishes at different costs and everyone needs to provide different discounts.
		Therefore, now we will request the user to enter the necessary data in the text field.<br>
		<br>
		<b>We will use the already known function to us prompt.</b> In each of the following variables <b>clientName</b>,
		<b>clientSpentToday</b> and <b>clientSpentForAllTime</b> assigning the value that the user will introduce into the
		text
		field. Final data
		<b>clientSpentToday</b> and <b>clientSpentForAllTime</b> should be a type of data number.<br>
		<br>
		For <b>clientName</b> message in prompt must be “Enter the name of the client”, <br>
		<b>clientSpentToday</b> - “How much did the client spend today?”,<br>
		<b>clientSpentForAllTime</b> - “How much did the client spent all the time?”.<br>
		<br>
		<b>If the user entered the wrong data for clientSpentToday and clientSpentForAllTime</b> (for example, “hello”),
		then
		bring out
		in the modal window text “The amount that the client spent for all the time and which was spent today should be a
		number!
		Reload the page to repeat the attempt.” With incorrect data, do not let the user go further to
		discount calculation. Use if else, to realize this logic
