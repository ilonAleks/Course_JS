	<h3>6-Additional</h3>
	<p>
		When we are registering, in most cases we ask for a password. And there are always some for him
		restrictions on the length or symbols. Now you will write a program that will check the password for validity,
		introduced by the user.<br>
		<br>
		<b>First you need </b>to request a password from the user using prompt. Display the message “Enter
		password".<br>
		<br>
		<b>The password must satisfy the following conditions:</b>
	<ol>
		<li>The length of the password should be at least 3 characters and no more than 20 characters (including 20). </li>
		<li> The password must contain at least 1 capital (large) letter. </li>
		<li> The password must contain at least 1 digit.</li>
	</ol>
	<b>If all conditions are satisfied,</b> then withdraw alert Message “The password is valid. Welcome to
	account! ”, otherwise - “The password doesn't satisfy the conditions! Reload the page and try it again.”<br>
	<br>
	<b>Look at several possible results:</b>
	<ol>
		<li>“1234f” - does not satisfy the conditions</li>
		<li>“123456” - does not satisfy the conditions</li>
		<li>“1234F” - satisfies the conditions</li>
		<li>“12” - does not satisfy the conditions</li>
		<li>“JavaScript”- does not satisfy the conditions</li>
		<li>“JavaScript123” - satisfies the conditions</li>
	</ol>
