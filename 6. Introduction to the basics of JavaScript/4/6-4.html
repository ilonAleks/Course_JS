	<h3>Task 4</h3>
	<p>
		Have you ever passed tests?I think your answer is yes, since they are everywhere.Now almost all tests were
		transferred to
		online format and are placed on websites that are developing web developers.Now you will create a small
		mathematics test for primary school students. <br>
		<br>
		<b>There are only 5 questions in the test:</b>
	<ol>
		<li>How much will be 2 + 2? </li>
		<li> How much will be 2 * 2? </li>
		<li> Petya had 5 apples. 3 of them he ate, 1 gave it to a friend. How many apples Petya has? </li>
		<li> Masha had 10 sweets. 2 she ate, 1 gave it to a friend. After her mother gave Masha another 5 sweets. How many
			sweets are ultimately
			remained by Masha? </li>
		<li> How much will be 2 + 2 * 2?</li>
	</ol>
	<b>You need to </b> help primary school students, so we will make a test for them that will check their knowledge
	Mathematics. <br>
	<BR>
	Each question and a pre-prepared correct answer (the answers must be a type of data number) keep in
	variables. Bring out the questions using a function <b>prompt</b> and also maintain the value introduced by the user
	in
	separate variables. <br>
	<BR>
	<b> If the answer was given correctly, </b> then display the message “That's right!” using <b>alert</b>, otherwise -
	"That answer isn't right!".
	Even if the answer was given incorrectly, the user must still be redirected to the next question.<br>
	<br>
	<b>You also need to </b> account for the correct and wrong answers. Save this data in variables
	<b>correctAnswers</b>
	and <b>incorrectAnswers</b> respectively. After performing the test with alert bring the message “End of the test!
	Correct answers - correctAnswers; Incorrect answers - incorrectAnswers.” (Replace correctAnswers and
	incorrectAnswers to the final values).<br>
	<br>
	<b>Note: </b> note that Prompt returns the data type string, but the values that should be stored in variables with
	answers are a data type number.
