	<h3>Task 13-5</h3>
	<p>
		In the last task, you created a dictionary. The customer is satisfied with the work done and the development team
		too.
		Since you have already dealt with the technology of the dictionary, you were asked to implement another dictionary.
		The customer wants to create a new category of words “Difficult words”.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Use the code </b> written in the last task.
		You need to create a daughter class <b>HardWordsDictionary</b> from the class <b>Dictionary</b>.
		Constructor in <b>HardWordsDictionary</b> take NAME parameter also accepts and calls the parent class
		constructor.<br>
		<br>
		All methods that are in <b>Dictionary</b>, should remain unchanged in <b>HardWordsDictionary</b>, except one.
		You need to reduce the method <b>add</b>, which should work according to the same logic as <b>add</b> in
		<b>Dictionary</b>, only the object of the word should look as follows:<br>
		<br>
		{<br>
		&nbsp word: 'word',<br>
		&nbsp description: 'description',<br>
		&nbsp isDifficult: true,<br>
		}<br>
		<br>
		<b>For class test HardWordsDictionary</b> use this code:<br>
		<br>
		const hardWordsDictionary = new HardWordsDictionary('Difficult words')<br>
		hardWordsDictionary.add('Amateur', 'anyone who is engaged in science or art without special training, possessing
		only superficial knowledge.')<br>
		hardWordsDictionary.add('Neologism', 'new word or expression, as well as the new meaning of the old word.')<br>
		<br>
		hardWordsDictionary.add('Quantum', 'the indivisible part of any value in physics.')<br>
		hardWordsDictionary.showAllWords()<br>
		<br>
		// Amateur - anyone who is engaged in science or art without special training, possessing only superficial
		knowledge.<br>
		// Quantum - the indivisible part of any value in physics.
