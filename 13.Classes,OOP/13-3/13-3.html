	<h3>Task 13-3</h3>
	<p>
		Your friend Artem is the owner of a car service.
		Now all applications for repairing machines are processed manually, which of course is not very convenient.
		Therefore, Artem asked you as a web developer to help in automation of this process.<br>
		<br>
		<b>You need to </b> create a class <b>CarService</b>, in the constructor of which 2 parameters will be transmitted:
	<ol>
		<li>name. The name of the car service.</li>
		<li>workingHours. The object in which the keys are stored from and till. <br>
			from means the time of the start of the working day for the car service,
			<br>till - End of the end of the working day.<br>
			Знtime of time is recorded in format “h:mm” (for example, 9:00).
		</li>
	</ol>
	<b>Initialize these parameters </b> using<b> this</b>.
	Also, the parameter <b>workingHours</b> is optional.
	Therefore, create a value (data type <b>object</b>) default.
	This object should be called <b>DefaultWorkingHours</b> and be static.
	If the parameter <b>workingHours</b> not transferred, then substitute in<b>this.workingHours</b> meaning from
	<b>DefaultWorkingHours</b>, which is equal:<br>
	<br>
	static DefaultWorkingHours = {<br>
	&nbsp from: '9:00',<br>
	&nbsp till: '20:00',<br>
	}<br>
	<br>
	<b>Add </b> to class a method called <b>repairCar</b>, which should take in 1 parameter
	<b>carName</b> (car name for repair, data type<b>string</b>).<br>
	<br>
	If <b>carName</b> not transmitted, then display the error You need to specify the name of your car in order to repair
	it”
	in the console through <b>console.error</b>. The function of the function should end with this.<br>
	<br>
	If the parameter <b>carName</b> was transferred to <b>repairCar</b>, Then you need to compare the current clock with
	the time of the car service.
	If the current time (clock) is not included in the range of the car service, then display via alert message
	“Unfortunately, we are now closed. Come back tomorrow”. Otherwise withdraw the message
	“Now we will repair your car carName! Please expect” (carName - parameter of the method repairCar).<br>
	<br>
	<b>Note:</b>
	When comparing the time, take into account only the clock, do not pay attention for minutes.
	Let the minutes always be a line “00”.<br>
	<br>
	<b>For the test of performance </b> class <b>CarService</b> use this code:<br>
	<br>
	const carService = new CarService('RepairCarNow', { from: '8:00', till: '20:00' });<br>
	carService.repairCar('BMW');<br>
	<br>
	<b>Hint:</b> <br>
	In order to extract from the line “8:00”, you can use the watch value .split(':'),
	get the first element from the resulting array and transform it to the number.
