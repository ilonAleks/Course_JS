	<h3>Task 13-4</h3>
	<p>
		You were entrusted with the task on the project.
		It is necessary to develop a dictionary in which you can add words with their description, delete words and receive
		them.<br>
		<br>
		<b>To get started </b> create a class <b>Dictionary</b>, the constructor of which takes 1 parameter <b>name</b>.
		Initialize this value with the help <b>this</b>. Also, the constructor should be declared a field <b>words</b>,
		which by default should be an empty object.<br>
		<br>
		<b>You need </b> to class <b>Dictionary</b> add 3 methods:
	<ol>
		<li>add. This method takes 2 parameters: word - word, type of data string;
			description - Description of the word, type of data string.
			Assign to the Words object by Word (the ADD method parameter) the value of the object in which data on the word
			and its description will be stored. An example of such an object:<br>
			<br>
			{<br>
			&nbsp word: 'word',<br>
			&nbsp description: 'description',<br>
			}<br>
			<br>
			<b>If the word </b> already exists in the object <b>words</b>, You do not need to rewrite the word that has
			already been preserved earlier.
		</li>
		<li>remove. This method takes the key from the Words object, according to which you need to remove the word and
			deleys this word from the object.</li>
		<li>get. This method takes the key from the Words object. It is necessary to return the word found from the method
			according to the transmitted key parameter.</li>
		<li>showAllWords. Данный метод не принимает в себя никаких параметров.
			Its task is to bring all the words that are in the Words object to the console in format “word - description”
			(word - the word, description -
			description of the word).</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<b>To test the written class </b> use this code:<br>
	<br>
	const dictionary = new Dictionary('Explanatory dictionary');<br>
	dictionary.add('JavaScript', 'popular programming language');<br>
	dictionary.add('Web developer', 'a person who creates new services and sites or supports and complements the
	existing');<br>
	<br>
	dictionary.remove('JavaScript');<br>
	dictionary.showAllWords();<br>
	// Web developer - a person who creates new services and sites or supports and complements the existing
	</p>
	<script src="13-4.js"></script>
