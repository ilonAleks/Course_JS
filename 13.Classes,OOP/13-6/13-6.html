	<h3>Task 13-6</h3>
	<p>
		<b>You are well done! </b> You have implemented logic for two dictionaries and they work perfectly.
		But then a senior developer comes to you and says that you need to use encapsulation in your code, as this is an
		important principle of OOP.<br>
		<br>
		You certainly agree with the senior developer.
		He advised you to make the fields <b> name </b> and <b> words </b> private.
		Implement this using the sign of the lattice “#”.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Now you need to </b> add getters and setters for fields words and name in class <b>Dictionary</b>.
		For name, name the getter <b>mainName</b>, and setter - <b>setMainName</b>.
		For <b>words</b> name the getter <b>allWords</b>, and setter - <b>addNewWord</b>.
		<b>mainName, setMainName</b> and <b>allWords</b> should be defined using keywords <b>set</b> or <b>get</b>. <br>
		<br>
		But <b>addNewWord</b> is necessary to create as a regular method that accepts 2 parameters:
		<b>word</b> - word, type of data string; <b>description</b> - word description, data type string.
		Method <b>addNewWord</b> should create a new word in the object <b>words</b> without any checks.
		<b>addNewWord</b> realized without <b>set</b>, because <b>set</b> cannot take more than the 1st parameter.<br>
		<br>
		After you made the fields private and created getters and setters, you need to fix logic for classes
		<b>Dictionary</b> and <b>HardWordsDictionary</b>.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Test the final code </b> on this example:<br>
		<br>
		const hardWordsDictionary = new HardWordsDictionary('Difficult words');<br>
		hardWordsDictionary.add('Amateur', 'anyone who is engaged in science or art without special training, possessing
		only superficial knowledge.');<br>
		hardWordsDictionary.add('Neologism', 'new word or expression, as well as the new meaning of the old word.');<br>
		hardWordsDictionary.add('Quantum', 'the indivisible part of any value in physics.');<br>
		<br>
		hardWordsDictionary.remove('Neologism');<br>
		hardWordsDictionary.showAllWords();<br>
		<br>
		console.log(hardWordsDictionary.mainName); // Difficult words<br>
		hardWordsDictionary.setMainName = 'New Dictionary';<br>
		console.log(hardWordsDictionary.mainName); // New Dictionary<br>
		console.log(hardWordsDictionary.allWords); //displays an object in which there are words Amateur and Quantum
