	<h3>Task 13-7</h3>
	<p>
		Your company creates an internal product to facilitate control over the growth of its developers. You were
		instructed to realize such a product.<br>
		<br>
		<b>First you need to </b> create a class <b>Developer</b>, the designer of which will take 3 parameters:
	<ol>
		<li>fullName. The name of the developer.</li>
		<li>age. Developer age.</li>
		<li>position. The current position of the developer in the company (for example, Junior, Middle, Senior).</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<b>Initialize all parameters </b> using <b>this</b>. Also create a field inside the designer <b>technologies</b>,
	which by default will be equal to an empty array.<br>
	<br>
	Besides in class <b>Developer</b> you need to create 2 methods:
	<ol>
		<li>code. A method whose body is originally empty (there is nothing in curly brackets).</li>
		<li>learnNewTechnology. This method takes 1 parameter Technology, which should be added to the end of the array
			technologies.</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<b>After the actions done </b> you should get a template <b>Developer</b>, thanks to which you will create
	subsidiaries.<br>
	<br>
	<b>You now need to </b> create 3 subsidiaries from class <b>Developer</b>
	<ol>
		<li>JuniorDeveloper. The designer of this class accepts 2 parameters: fullName и age.
			Call the parent class designer and hand over these 2 parameters there. As the 3rd we have position.
			You need to indicate it by default. Write the meaning “Junior” as a 3rd parameter of a parent constructor call.
			Besides reinstall the method code, so that he leads the line into the console “Junior developer writes the
			code...”.
			Array technologies should contain the following technologies: 'HTML', 'CSS', 'JavaScript'.</li>
		<li>MiddleDeveloper. Do the same work in the constructor as JuniorDeveloper. Only in place position
			submit the meaning “Middle”. Method code in class MiddleDeveloper should take a line into the console “Middle
			developer writes the code...”. Array technologies should contain the following technologies: 'HTML', 'CSS',
			'JavaScript',
			‘React’.</li>
		<li>SeniorDeveloper. Do the same work in the constructor as JuniorDeveloper. Only in place position
			submit the meaning “Senior”. Method code in class SeniorDeveloper should take a line into the console “Senior
			developer writes the code...”. Array technologies should contain the following technologies: 'HTML', 'CSS',
			'JavaScript',
			‘React’, ‘NodeJS’.</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<b>Note:</b> When you are decide the method <b>code</b> in subsidiaries, you use the principle of polymorphism.<br>
	<br>
	<b>Test the written classes </b> using this code:<br>
	<br>
	juniorDeveloper.code(); // Junior developer writes the code...<br>
	middleDeveloper.code(); // Middle developer writes the code...<br>
	seniorDeveloper.code(); // Senior developer writes the code...<br>
	<br>
	console.log(juniorDeveloper.fullName, juniorDeveloper.age, <br>
	juniorDeveloper.position); // 'Anastasia', 20, 'Junior'<br>
	console.log(middleDeveloper.fullName, middleDeveloper.age, <br>
	middleDeveloper.position); // 'Igor', 25, 'Middle'<br>
	console.log(seniorDeveloper.fullName, seniorDeveloper.age, <br>
	seniorDeveloper.position); // 'Maxim', 30, 'Senior'
	</p>
