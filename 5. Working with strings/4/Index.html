	<h3>Task 4</h3>
	<p>
		Indeed, the text that the user introduces can sometimes be completely unpredictable. And you have learned with this
		work. Congratulations!
		<BR>
		But in modern web applications there is usually more than one text field. Remember any form of registration. There
		is a minimum
		2 text fields (for example, login and password) and for each of them you need to format the line in a special way.
		<BR>

		<b> Now in the code from Task 3 you need to </b> create another modal window in which it will be requested
		User age. Pass the line "How old are you?" and the result introduced by the user save in
		userAge variable. The final result must satisfy the following conditions:
	<ol>
		<li>The value should be transformed to the type of Number data. </li>
		<li> At the beginning and at the end of the line there should not be extra gaps. </li>
	</ol>
	<b> After you take it to the modal window using alert </b> the line “You call username and you userAge years” (replace
	you
	userName and userAge for formatted text introduced by the user).
