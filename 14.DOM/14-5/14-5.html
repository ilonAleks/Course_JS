	<h3>Task 14-5</h3>
	<p>
		In order to successfully complete all your tasks on the project, it remains only to complete the deletion of tasks.
		To do this, there is a “delete” button.
		But sometimes users can accidentally press the button and the task will be removed because of this.
		For this, modal windows are usually created that ask the user, whether he really wants to remove the task.
		Now you will need to implement such a modal window.<br>
		<br>
		You already have styles for the modal window and the HTML step.
		<b> Create the HTML-element of the modal window </b> using JavaScript and add it inside the tag <b>body</b>.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Modal window template:</b><br>
		<xmp>
			<div class="modal-overlay modal-overlay_hidden">
				<div class="delete-modal">
					<h3 class="delete-modal__question">
						Do you really want to delete this task?
					</h3>
					<div class="delete-modal__buttons">
						<button class="delete-modal__button delete-modal__cancel-button">
							Cancel
						</button>
						<button class="delete-modal__button delete-modal__confirm-button">
							Delete
						</button>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div>
		</xmp>
		Class <b> “modal-overlay_hidden” </b> is responsible for the opening and closing of the modal window.
		If it is open, then the class <b> “modal-overlay_hidden” </b> is not, if closed, then the class <b>
			“modal-overlay_hidden” </b> is present.<br>
		<br>
		<b>You need to </b> open a modal window after clicking on any button “Delete” near each task.
		Hang the processor of the event <b> “click” </b> on the element with the class <b> “Tasks-list” </b>.
		Use delegation of events to catch clicks on buttons to delete tasks.<br>
		<br>
		There are 2 buttons in the modal window: “cancel” and “delete”.
		“Cancel” closes the modal window, and “delete” - removes the task from the TASKS array and from DOM -Derev and
		closes the modal window.<br>
		<br>
		<b>To delete the task </b> use the attribute <b>data-task-id</b>, which contains information about the property <b>
			id </b> object of the task from array <b>tasks</b>.
		According to this <b> id </b> you can find the desired task and delete it.<br>
		<br>
		<b>You have the initial files. </b> Use them to develop an application logic:<br>
