	<h3>Task 14-4</h3>
	<p>
		<b>You are well done! </b> You coped with the task and gave it to the code of the senior developer.
		But the senior developer found that there is no need to send a form if the value is empty or the task with the same
		name already exists.
		Therefore, you are asked to add validation to your code.<br>
		<br>
		For an error bloc <b>, create a span </b> tag with the <b> “error-me-bank” </b>.
		A text with an error will be placed inside this tag. <br>
		<br>
		If the form was sent with an empty field, then display the error “The name of the problem should not be empty” by
		adding an error with an error with the class <b> “Create-Task-Block” </b>.
		If the task with the name introduced in the field already exists, then reflect the error “The task with this name
		already exists.”<br>
		<br>
		If there was no error form when sending the form of errors, then remove the error block if it exists in DOM and
		create a new task in the list.<br>
		<br>
		<b>You have the initial files. </b> Use them to develop an application logic:<br>
