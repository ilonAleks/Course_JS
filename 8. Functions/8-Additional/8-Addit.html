	<h3>Task 8 Addition</h3>
	<p>
		Prior to this, you transmitted to the function such data as String, Number, Boolean. But in JavaScript function
		parameter
		You can convey anything, even a function. A function that is transmitted as a parameter to another function is
		called
		Callback. And you will work with this now.<br>
		<br>
		<b>First, create 2 functions</b> showSuccessMessage, which takes the parameter message and leads it to
		console
		through console.log; showErrorMessage, which assumes the Message parameter and takes it to the console through
		console.error (console.error it displays a message to the console in red). These functions will be our future
		Callbacks.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Now you need </b>to create another function called <b>checkTextOnErrorSymbol</b>. With it, we
		will look for
		text is prohibited and display an error into the console if such a symbol was found. <br>
		<br>
		<b>checkTextOnErrorSymbol accepts 4 parameters:</b>
	<ol>
		<li>text, Type of data string. It is responsible for the text in which we will look for the prohibited symbols</li>
		<li>errorSymbol, Type of data string. It is responsible for the prohibited symbol.</li>
		<li>successCallback. This function, which will display a successful message if there were no prohibited characters
			found.</li>
		<li>errorCallback. This function, which will display an error into the console, if a prohibited symbol has been
			found.</li>
	</ol>
	<b>If the prohibited symbol was found </b>, then call the flask <b>errorCallback</b> and pass the message into it
	“Found a prohibited symbol "${errorSymbol}" under the index ${i}.” (replace errorSymbol on the prohibited symbol, i -
	on the
	index lines in which the prohibited symbol was discovered.<br>
	<br>
	<b>If not a single prohibited symbol was found in the line </b>, then call the flask <b>successCallback</b> and
	pass it into it
	message "There are no prohibited characters in this text".<br>
	<br>
	Check the performance of your function on this code:<br>

	const text = 'Hello! How are you! For a long time you and I have not seen each other.'<br>
	checkTextOnErrorSymbol(text, 'а', showSuccessMessage, showErrorMessage);<br>
	<br>
	Для данного кода, в консоль должно быть выведено следующее:<br>
	Found a prohibited symbol "a" under the index 9<br>
	Found a prohibited symbol "a" under the index 15<br>
	Found a prohibited symbol "a" under the index 19<br>
	<br>
	<b>Hints:</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>In order to get a symbol of the line on the index, use the following record text[index].</li>
	</ol>
