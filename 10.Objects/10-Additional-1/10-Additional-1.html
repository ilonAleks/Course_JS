	<p>
		Imagine that you are developing an online food delivery store. You were set the task of calculating the total amount
		all goods in the basket.<br>
		<br>
		<b>You need to </b> create a function <b>getTotalPriceOfShoppingBag</b>, which will take 1 parameter
		shoppingBag. <b>shoppingBag</b> - This is an array of products in the basket consisting of objects in each of which
		information about the name of the product (product) and the quantity of the product in the basket are stored
		(quantity).<br>
		<br>
		<b>Also </b> the online store has a global object in which all the necessary information is stored about each unit
		product:<br>
		<br>
		const groceries = {<br>
		&nbsp "Orange Juice": {<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp price : 1.5,<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp discount: 10,<br>
		},<br>
		&nbsp "Chocolate": {<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp price : 2,<br>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp discount : 0,<br>
		},<br>
		// more items...<br>
		}<br>
		<br>
		Function <b>getTotalPriceOfShoppingBag</b> should return the total cost of all goods in the basket, taking into
		account discounts and
		given the number of products indicated by the client.The final value should be rounded to hundredths.It's possible
		do it with <b>toFixed</b> (<a
			href="https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toFixed"
			target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/...</a>)<br>
		<br>
		Look at the possible return value of the function <b>getTotalPriceOfShoppingBag</b>:<br>
		<br>
		const shoppingBag = [<br>
		&nbsp { product: 'Chocolate', quantity: 3 },<br>
		&nbsp { product: 'Orange Juice', quantity: 23 },<br>
		]<br>
		<br>
		const totalPrice = getTotalPriceOfShoppingBag(shoppingBag);<br>
		console.log('totalPrice', totalPrice); // Returns 37.05
