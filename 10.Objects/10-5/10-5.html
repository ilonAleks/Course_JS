	<h3>Task 10-5</h3>
	<p>
		Have you ever played the lottery? The lottery is a game in which the winner is randomly determined and give him
		win. Now your task will be to develop logic for such a game.<br>
		<br>
		<b>You need to </b> create a function <b>getWinner</b>, which accepts 2 parameters:<br>
	<ol>
		<li>applicants. An object in which the keys are the numbers of people by which random selection will be made, and
			meanings -
			these are objects of candidates for winning in the lottery.</li>
		<li>winnerObject. This is an object that stores only 1 Prize key that stores the winnings in the lottery.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<b>You need to </b> randomly choose a winning number (random key in the object applicants) and return from
	functions
	<b>getWinner</b> an object in which properties will be stored from <b>winnerObject</b> and the object of the
	winner.<br>
	<br>
	To obtain random value in the range, use the following function:<br>
	<br>
	function getRandomNumberInRange(min, max) {<br>
	&nbsp return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min;<br>
	}<br>
	<br>


	Example of the return result of the function <b>getWinner</b>:<br>
	<br>
	const todaysWinner = {<br>
	&nbsp prize: '10 000$',<br>
	}<br>
	<br>
	const winnerApplicants = {<br>
	&nbsp '001': {<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp name: 'Maxim',<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp age: 25,<br>
	&nbsp },<br>
	&nbsp '201': {<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp name: 'Svetlana',<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp age: 20,<br>
	&nbsp },<br>
	&nbsp '304': {<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp name: 'Catherine',<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp age: 35,<br>
	&nbsp },<br>
	}<br>
	<br>
	const resultWinner = getWinner(winnerApplicants, todaysWinner);<br>
	console.log('resultWinner', resultWinner); // { prize: '10 000$', name: 'Catherine', age: 35 }
