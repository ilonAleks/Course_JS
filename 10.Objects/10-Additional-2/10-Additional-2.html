	<h3>Task 10-Additional-2</h3>
	<p>
		A customer came to you, who is the owner of one of the game web platforms. He wants you to develop for
		His site is a new game that will conquer the hearts of many users.<br>
		<br>
		<b>The game has 2 players </b>: hero and enemy. They will fight each other. Each player has a health scale,
		which initially, it is 100. With each hit, the opposite player is taken away by 10 units of health. The one wins.
		Who is the health of more than 0.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Now you need to </b> create a function <b>startGame</b>, which will accept 2 parameters:
	<ol>
		<li>heroPlayer. The object of the player that contains the properties of NAME - the name of the hero; Health - a
			health scale that
			initially equal to 100; Heatenemy - a function that takes the Enemy object and takes away from the Enemy 10 object
			Health units (Health key).</li>
		<li>enemyPlayer. The object of the enemy, which contains the properties of NAME - the name of the hero; Health - a
			health scale that
			initially equal to 100; Heathero - a function that takes the Hero object and takes away from the Hero object 10
			units
			Health (Health key).</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<b>Inside the function startGame you need to </b> randomly generate a number from 0 to 1. If 0 falls, then
	need
	call the method heatEnemy at the object <b>heroPlayer</b>, if 1 - then heatHero at <b>enemyPlayer</b>. <br>
	<br>
	<b>For this </b> so that the function generates random values several times and players fight until someone has
	will end life, it is recommended to use the While cycle, which will be executed until any player has a Health property
	Less or equal to zero.<br>
	<br>
	<b>After completing the cycle, it is necessary</b> determine which player won and display a message through alert
	“${name}
	won! He has left ${health} health”, where name and health - the values of the properties of the winner player.<br>
	<br>
	<b>To generate random values </b> use the following function.<br>
	<br>
	function getRandomNumberInRange(min, max) {<br>
	&nbsp return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min;<br>
	}<br>
	<br>
	<b>To verify performance </b> functions <b>startGame</b> Use this code. There are no methods in it
	<b>heatEnemy</b> and <b>heatHero</b>, to you
	it is necessary to implement them themselves.<br>
	<br>
	const hero = {<br>
	&nbsp name: 'Batman',<br>
	&nbsp health: 100,<br>
	}<br>
	<br>
	const enemy = {<br>
	&nbsp name: 'Joker',<br>
	&nbsp health: 100,<br>
	}<br>
	startGame(hero, enemy);
