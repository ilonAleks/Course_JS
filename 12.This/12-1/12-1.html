	<h3>Task 12-1</h3>
	<p>
		Imagine that you as a web developer were asked to develop a web platform that will track progress
		students in learning web development.<br>
		<br>
		<b>First you need to </b> create an object <b>student</b>, in which there will be 3 properties:
	<ol>
		<li>stack. The array of lines, where each line is a technology. Initially, the stack array should be equal [‘HTML’].
		</li>
		<li>level. Number data type. Level is responsible for the current level of the student and is originally equal 1.
		</li>
		<li>improveLevel. A function that first increases the value of the level property in a unit.
			If Level is 2, then you need to add to the end of the stack array ‘CSS’,
			if 3 - add to the end of the stack value ‘JavaScript’,
			4 - ‘React’,
			5 - ‘NodeJS’. If the Level value has become more than 5, then you need to display in the modal window through
			Alert Message “The student has learned all the technologies!”.
			Also a function improveLevel must return the updated object at the very end student.</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<b>In the end </b> the value of the property <b>stack</b> After performing the code below it should be equal to
	["HTML", "CSS",
	"JavaScript", "React",
	"NodeJS"].<br>
	<br>
	student<br>
	&nbsp .improveLevel()<br>
	&nbsp .improveLevel()<br>
	&nbsp .improveLevel()<br>
	&nbsp .improveLevel()<br>
	&nbsp .improveLevel()<br>
	<br>
	<b>Note: </b> a chain from a row of coming functions impoveLevel works like this because improveLevel returns
	an object student, and the student object has a method impoveLevel. <br>
	<br>
	<b>Look for an example:</b><br>
	<br>
	const student = {<br>
	&nbsp improveLevel() {<br>
	&nbsp &nbsp return this;<br>
	&nbsp }<br>
	};<br>
	<br>
	student<br>
	&nbsp .improveLevel()<br>
	&nbsp .improveLevel()<br>
	&nbsp .improveLevel()
	</p>
