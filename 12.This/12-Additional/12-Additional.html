	<h3>Task 12-Additional</h3>
	<p>
		One owner of a small startup came to you. He offers you to make a game that will amaze the game industry.
		You certainly agree, since the proposal sounds tempting.<br>
		<br>
		<b>The essence of the game is </b> that there are 2 castles (attacking and defending) that are at war together.
		User play for the attacking castle. The king of the attacking castle must every time calculate the possibilities of
		capturing the warring
		castle. When the possibility is large enough, you must not attack without hesitation.<br>
		<br>
		<b>In the code</b> you have 2 objects initially <b>attacker</b> and <b>defender</b> which are the analogies of locks
		and which have properties responsible for the number of combat units of each type. For example, <b>archer</b> -
		these are archers,
		<b>footSoldiers</b> - these are
		infantrymens, etc.<br>
		<br>
		const attacker = {<br>
		&nbsp; archer: 30,<br>
		&nbsp; footSoldier: 55,<br>
		&nbsp; cavalry: 10,<br>
		&nbsp; artillery: 3,<br>
		}<br>
		<br>
		const defender = {<br>
		&nbsp; archer: 33,<br>
		&nbsp; footSoldier: 50,<br>
		&nbsp; cavalry: 40,<br>
		&nbsp; artillery: 10,<br>
		}<br>
		<br>
		<b>In the Attacker object, you need to create 3 functions:</b>
	<ol>
		<li>checkChancesToWin. Checks the chances of an attacking castle to capture a defending castle.This function accepts
			1 parameter
			defenderObject, which is an object defender. <br>
			checkChancesToWin The number of combat units from both castles must be verified.For example, if the attacking
			castle has a greater value of the Archer property than that of the defender, then 1 must add 1 to the chances of
			capture (initially the value of chances should be zero).
			<br>The function should return an array in which the 1st element is the chances of an attacking castle for
			capture, and the 2nd is the value of the maximum chance of capture (the number of keys in the defenderObject
			object).That is, if the attacking castle of the properties of Archer and Cavalry has more than the defending, and
			the other values of the properties are less, then the chances of capture should be [2, 4] (figuratively the
			chances are 2 of 4 or 50%).
		</li>
		<li>improveArmy. Adds to each numerical value of the Attacker object by 5 units (updates the properties of Archer,
			FootSoldier, Cavalry, Artillery). This function does not accept any parameters.</li>
		<li>attack. It takes 1 parameter - this is the Defender object. First, this function checks if the chances of
			capture (values from the function checkChancesToWin) less than 70% of the maximum chances, then it is necessary to
			intensify (call the function improveArmy) and display a message via Alert “Our chances are equal
			${ourArmyChances}/${maximumChances}.
			Must be strengthened!” (ourArmyChances - the chances of an attacking castle for capture, maximumChances - the
			maximum chance of capture). Otherwise, you need to display a message in the modal window “We intensified! We will
			undoubtedly win! Our
			chances are high!”.</li>
	</ol>
	<b>Example result </b> function of function <b>attack:</b><br>

	attacker.attack(defender); // Our chances are equal 1/4. Must be strengthened!<br>
	attacker.attack(defender); // Our chances are equal 2/4. Must be strengthened!<br>
	attacker.attack(defender); // We intensified! We will undoubtedly win! Our chances are high!
