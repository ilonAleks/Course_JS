	<h3>Task 12-2</h3>
	<p>
		You have 2 objects <b>dog</b> and <b>bird</b>, which contains their description.<br>
		<br>
		const dog = {<br>
		&nbsp; name: 'Charlie',<br>
		&nbsp; type: 'Dog',<br>
		&nbsp; makeSound() {<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; return 'Woof-woof'<br>
		&nbsp; }<br>
		}<br>
		<br>
		const bird = {<br>
		&nbsp; name: 'Peatya',<br>
		&nbsp; type: 'Sparrow', <br>
		&nbsp; makeSound() {<br>
		&nbsp; &nbsp; return 'Chic-chiric';<br>
		&nbsp; }<br>
		}<br>
		<br>
		You need to create a function <b>makeDomestic</b>, which will display all the information about the animal using the
		message to the console “type named name says sound”, where <b>name</b> - The name of the animal, <b>type</b> - its
		type and <b>sound</b> - the result of the call of the function makeSound.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Also a function makeDomestic</b> must return a new object of the animal, in which there will be all the
		parameters that were before that (name, type, makeSound), as well as a new parametr <b>isDomestic</b>, which is a
		type of data <b>boolean</b> and it shows whether the animal is domestic or not. <br>
		<br>
		To indicate the value for the property <b>isDomestic</b> (true or false) you need to transfer it as a parameter to a
		function
		<b>makeDomestic</b>.<br>
		<br>
		<b>In addition, </b> inside the function <b>makeDomestic</b> must only use <b>this</b>. That is you are allowed to
		turn to the properties of the animal only
		<b>this.name</b> or <b>this.makeSound</b>, but not bird.name or bird.makeSound.<br>
		<br>
		<b>You need to </b> solve this problem in 3 ways: through <b>bind, call and apply</b>. Call the function
		<b>makeDomestic</b> 3 times
		using these methods. Using bind, function makeDomestic should work with the object dog, at apply and
		call - with an object bird. Do not forget to transfer the parameter isDomestic in a function when calling it.
