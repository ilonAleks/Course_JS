	<p>
		You just focused, decided to start writing your code and work productively. But Peter comes up to you again and
		asks him to help. You tell him that you will help him for the last time today.<br>
		<br>
		<b>This program does not work for Peter now:</b><br>
		<br>
		const salaryOfJuniorDeveloper = 500;<br>
		const numberOfJuniorDevelopers = 3;<br>
		let taxPercentage = 13;<br>
		let totalJuniorDevelopersSalary;<br>
		<br>
		for (let i = 0; i < numberOfJuniorDevelopers; i +=1) {<br>
			const salaryWithTax = salaryOfJuniorDeveloper - (salaryOfJuniorDeveloper * taxPercentage / 100);<br>
			totalJuniorDevelopersSalary += salaryWithTax;<br>
			}<br>
			console.log('totalJuniorDevelopersSalary', totalJuniorDevelopersSalary);<br>
			<br>
			In this code <b>totalJuniorDevelopersSalary</b> for some reason, it displays the meaning <b>NaN</b>.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Correct all errors so that the program works correctly.</b> Also fulfill the following conditions: the bug must
			to be
			fixed with the help console.log or debugger, at least one should be present in the code console.log or
