	<h3>Task 7-1</h3>
	<p>
		Peter is a novice web developer, and he does not quite understand the spelling of the code on JavaScript. He tried
		to write
		program that requests the input of the number for the “Health” parameter in the game. <br>
		<br>
		<b>If the entered number </b> is less or equal to zero or value <b>health</b> is false, then in the modal window
		must text is displayed: “The “Health” parameter should be more than zero!”, <b> otherwise </b> - “the parameter” of
		health is equal
		${health}”, where
		<b>health</b> - the “Health” parameter introduced by the user.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Look at the code </b> that Peter wrote.<br>
		let health = prompt('Enter the number of "Health" parameter for the character')<br>
		<br>
		if () {<br>
		&nbsp health < 0 || health!<br>
			&nbsp alert('The "Health" parameter should be more than zero!')<br>
			} else () {<br>
			&nbsp alert(`The parameter "Health" is equal ${Health}`);<br>
			}<br>
			<br>
			The code does not look quite correct, right? Since you are already a more experienced web developer than Peter,
			then your
			task is to help him fix the bug. <br>
			<BR>
			<b> Correct all errors so that the program works correctly. </b> also fulfill the following conditions: the bug
			should
			to be
			fixed with the help console.log or debugger, at least one should be present in the code console.log or
			debugger.
