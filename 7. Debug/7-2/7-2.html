	<h3>Task 7-2</h3>
	<p>
		Well, I think you showed Peter how to write the right and clean code. Well done! <br>
		But Peter has taught much about, since solving one problem is not enough to understand the programming language
		JavaScript. Peter decided to practice more, completed a new task, but again failure. He cannot figure out why
		the error pops up and does not work. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Your goal is the same:</b> show Peter how to correctly solve problems such as find bugs in the code and show
		your professionalism is in this matter.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Look at this code:</b><br>
		<br>
		const temperatureInCelsius = prompt('Enter the temperature in degrees Celsius');<br>
		<br>
		if (temperatureInCelsius === 0) {<br>
		alert('0 Celsius degrees - this is the temperature of freezing water')<br>
		} else if (temperatureInCelsius > 0) {<br>
		alert('To freeze water, the temperature should be 0 degrees Celsius or below');<br>
		}<br>
		<br>
		const temperatureInFahrenheit = (temperatureIncelsius) * 9 / 5 + 32;<br>
		alert(`%{temperatureInCelsius} Celsius degrees is %{temperatureInFahrenheit} to Fahrenheit.`);<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Peter has the following errors:</b>
	<ol>
		<li>When he enters into a text field 0, then he does not display a message “0 Celsius degrees - this is the
			temperature of freezing water”</li>
		<li>The message is not displayed “%{temperatureInCelsius} Celsius degrees is %{temperatureInFahrenheit} to
			Fahrenheit.”</li>
		<li>In the message “%{temperatureInCelsius} Celsius degrees is %{temperatureInFahrenheit} to Fahrenheit.” data
			from variables temperatureInCelsius and temperatureInFahrenheit for some reason they are not substituted in a
			line.</li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<b>Correct all errors so that the program works correctly. </b> Also fulfill the following conditions: the bug should
	be
	fixed
	with help console.log or debugger, at least one should be present in the code console.log or debugger.
