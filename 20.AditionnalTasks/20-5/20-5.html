	<h3>Task 20-5</h3>
	<p>
		You are looking forward to your birthday. You want to know how many days are left before the holiday. In order not
		to count manually, you decided to write an <b>application that will calculate and show you the remaining time until
			the event</b> instead of you<br>
		You also decided to make the application more versatile. It is necessary to count the remaining time not necessarily
		until the birthday. The user himself can specify the name of the event<br>
		<b>Application operation:</b><br>
	<ol>
		<li>We ask the user for a date in the format "dd.mm.yyyy" via prompt</li>
		<li> We ask the user for the name of the event (also through prompt)</li>
		<li> We calculate the remaining time using js (based on the current date and the date passed by the user)</li>
		<li> We display the text on the page: <i>Remaining until the event: "(here is the name of the event from the user)"
				Days: (number of days), hours: (number of hours), minutes: (number of minutes), seconds: (number of in
				seconds)</i></li>
		<li> Every second, the inscription with the remaining time should be redrawn and the time should decrease</li>
	</ol>
	<i>Note. You can use setInterval to redraw the date. Also don't forget to break the application into functions.</i>
