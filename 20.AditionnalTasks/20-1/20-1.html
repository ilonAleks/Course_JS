	<h3>Task 20-1</h3>
	<p>
		You received an order from school. Primary school teachers are very busy and have no time to do homework. The school
		requires the development of a program that will generate mathematical examples instead of the teacher and check
		them.<br>
		<br>
		<b>First</b> you need to develop a <b>createMathTest</b> function that will generate mathematical examples from 2
		numbers using 4
		arithmetic signs ("+", "-", "*", "/")<br>
		You can transfer 2 parameters to the characteristic, they are configured by the teacher according to the action
		depending on the load.<br>
		<br>
		<b>The first parameter</b> is the allowable value of numbers that are included in the territory of the Russian
		Federation.<br>
		<br>
		<b>The second parameter</b> is the maximum value of the numbers<br>
		const mathTest = createMathTest(-100, +100)<br>
		<br>
		function createMathTest (minNum = 0, maxNum = 10) {<br>
		&nbsp // your code is here...<br>
		}<br>
		The function should return the type of the object:<br>
		{<br>
		&nbsp expression: '50 + 90',<br>
		&nbsp result: 140<br>
		}<br>
		<b>Next, you need</b> to create the user experience with <b>alerts</b> and <b>prompts</b>. Namely:
	<ol>
		<li>Indications example</li>
		<li>We receive a response from the user</li>
		<li>Compare the user's answer with the final answer</li>
		<li>We display the result of the execution (correct or not) + the user's answer. If the result is not correct, then
			you still need to show the correct answer.</li>
	</ol>
	<i>Note. In case examples, the answer should be rounded to 2 decimal places</i>
