	<h3>Task 20-2</h3>
	<p>
		You are participating in a competition. All participant tickets have numbers in the range <b>[1016; 1937]</b>. Each
		participant <b>can choose any free ticket with a number</b> from this range.<br>
		In secret, you were told that the winner is the ticket whose number <b>satisfies the following conditions</b>
	<ol>
		<li>divisible by 3 and 7</li>
		<li>not divisible by 5 and 2</li>
	</ol>
	Of these, <b>the ticket with the highest number</b> is the winning one.<br>
	<br>
	To win, <b>you need</b> to find out the ticket number and select it. Since a manual search will be long and
	irrational, then <b>write a program</b> that will find it for you.<br>
	What is the <b>winning ticket number</b>?
